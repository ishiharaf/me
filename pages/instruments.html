		<p>A list of instruments I currently own.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Copy of a Stradivarius Violin</li>
			<p class="comment">My second violin, bought in 2007. Made in the late 1910s. The previous owner told me that it's from an unknown Italian maker, and it was around 90 years old at the time I bought it. It remained my main instrument for years, and I still play it sometimes.</p>

			<li>Hering 1923 Vintage Harp in C</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2009. It's a very beautiful harmonica, but it was hard to play. It got stuck to my lips when playing, and bending was very hard to do. Played for about a year. I'm probably going to buy another harmonica and try again.</p>

			<li>Korg microKEY-37</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2016 to use with DAWs. Technically not an instrument, it's a MIDI controller, but can be used as one. Not really into DAWs anymore, but might use it again to engrave scores.</p>

			<li>Yamaha GL1 Guitalele</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2019 in a used goods store. It was pratically new when I bought it. I tune it as a regular guitar (EADGBe) instead of the standard guitalele tuning (ADGCEa). Even with higher tension strings, it's a bit out of tune. Rarely play it.</p>

			<li>Suzuki Bowlback Mandolin</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2019. Made in 1968 (No.228). Instantly got hooked. Because it's tuned the same as a violin, it didn't take me long to get used to the fretboard. There's not much classical repertoire for the mandolin, but there's a lot of stuff to play besides classical. Still play almost daily.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRA-314BIII Alto Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 as a set (YRSA-314BIII). My first recorder and my introduction to woodwinds. I liked the feel and sound of it, but the range felt restrictive when playing anything other than music written for the alto. Took me a while to get used to using the thumb, and I still struggle with the transition between G and A, and the highest notes. Still play it sometimes.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRS-314BIII Soprano Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 as a set (YRSA-314BIII). After getting used to the alto I tried the soprano. Even though I like the range of the instrument, I ended up not playing much because of the higher octave.</p>

			<li>Tony Dixon DX006 Tin Whistle in D</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. A tunable whistle made of aluminium. I initially bought it to play Irish music (mainly airs), but I didn't play a lot for the same reason I didn't play the soprano recorder. After I bought the Grenser, I began using it to play the same repertoire an octave higher. D# and F natural still require half-holing, but the fingering is almost the same between the two instruments. Still play it sometimes.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRT-304BII Tenor Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 to substitute my soprano, but ended up not getting used to the stretch required to play. May go back to it after improving my technique. </p>

			<li>Aulos 353B (E) Symphony Bass Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 with a hard case. Surprisingly, it's easier to play than the Yamaha tenor, despite its larger size. The range of the instrument, like the alto, felt somewhat restrictive. It's also a pain to clean, but I still play it sometimes.</p>

			<li>Aulos AF-1 Grenser Baroque Flute</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. Pitched at A=440Hz. Fingering is easier than the recorder, but took me a few weeks in order to get a consistent sound out of the instrument. Notes with forked-fingering sound different than regular ones, and it's hard to play in tune, but it has a beautiful sound overall and it's highly versatile. Out of all the wind instruments I own, this is the one I play the most.</p>

			<li>Zen-On G1A Bressan Alto Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. My second alto. It requires better breath control than the YRA-314B in order to play well. Has a bit of an airy sound. I tend to alternate between the Yamaha and the Zen-On sometimes to check how my technique is progressing.</p>

			<li>Aulos AF-3 Stanesby Jr. Baroque Flute</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. It came with a hard case (AF-3H). Pitched at A=415Hz. A bit harder to play than the Grenser due to the larger size. Due to it's tuning, I only use it to play baroque music sometimes.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRF-21 Fife</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 with the Aulos C-21. After a little bit of research, I found out that it's not really a fife due to it's new fingering. It has a weird mouthpiece, and a weak and airy sound.</p>

			<li>Aulos C-21 Pipit Fife</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 with the Yamaha YRF-21. Somewhat better than the Yamaha one. It has a normal mouthpiece, double-holes, and has a cork inside instead of a piece of plastic. It's fingered the same as the Yamaha fife, and sound really similar. I intend to go back to it sometime, even if I buy a true fife.</p>

			<li>Aulos 211A (E) Robin Tenor Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. It's easier to play than the Yamaha tenor due to the lack of keys, but still requires a big stretch. I don't play it a lot because I'm focusing on the baroque flute, and the range is pretty similar.</p>

			<li>Aulos 507B (E) Symphony Sopranino Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 to complete the family. Can be used to play alto/bass repertoire in a higher octave, or sopranino repertoire, but I barely play it.</p>

			<li>Aulos 501S (E) Symphony Garklein Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 to complete the family. There's some repertoire written specifically for the garklein that I'd like to learn in the future.</p>
