		<p>Learning an instrument is hard. It takes hours and hours of practice in order to become good at playing one. However, anyone can learn how to play an instrument, even if you start as an adult. I was around 15 years old when I started to learn the violin. I used to like woodwinds as a kid, but for some reason when I started to take music lessons, I chose the violin. After that I learned piano, cello, harmonica, mandolin, recorder, tin whistle, guitalele, viola, and I'm currently learning the baroque flute. I still play mandolin and baroque flute every day, and others when I feel like it.</p>

		<p>I tried to pour all the knowledge I've accumulated over the years after learning a bunch of instruments into this article. I hope it can be helpful. This article is aimed at adults, but most of it should still apply to children as well.</p>

		<h3>Where to start?</h3>
		<p>The first step is choosing an instrument. Which instrument you start with doesn't really matter. There's no right or wrong instrument for a beginner. What's important is that it's something you want to play; something you like the sound of. Learning an instrument boils down to lots of patience and consistent practice. Trying to keep yourself motivated to practice on an instrument you dislike is not easy to do, and usually leads people to give up learning.</p>

		<p>For this reason, I'd recommend you to avoid picking an instrument because it's cheap or because it's easy to learn. I'd also recommend against going for a similar instrument, or an instrument of the same family. You're better off starting directly on the instrument you want to play.</p>

		<p>In case you're already interested in a few instruments but you're unsure which one to choose, my suggestion is to research about each instrument and see which one suits your needs better. Check things like initial cost, ease of use, ease of learning, ease of transportation, maintenance, cost over time, etc. and make a decision based on that.</p>

		<p>In case you're not sure of what you want to learn, my suggestion is to get familiar with what's out there. Make a list of instruments that you're interested, and then filter your choice based on your finances, living place, personal taste, objectives, etc.</p>

		 <h4>Personal taste and objectives</h4>
		 <p>In terms of personal taste, the first question that comes to mind is: What kind of music do you usually listen to? This narrows down the options to what's being used in the music you listen to. If you listen to a lot of classical music, it's more likely that you're going to pick an instrument that's part of a modern orquestra, instead of for example, an electric guitar.</p>

		 <p>What kind of sound do you like? Do you like low or high sounds? Do you like melodies or harmonies? Do you like a single continuous sounds that can be sustained or do you like a shorter sound? - Introduces family of instruments here</p>
		 <p>When it comes down to objectives, you can narrow your options to: Do you want to play melody lines or do you want to play the accompaniment? Do you want to play in a group? What kind of group do you want to be a part of? Do you want to be able to sing while you accompany yourself and do a solo act? If your favorite genre of music is bluegrass and you want to sing while you accompany yourself, learning the harmonica is not a good idea. The guitar, banjo, or mandolin is a better fit in this case. Playing the fiddle is going to limit your ability to sing while playing, even though it's an instrument used in the genre.</p>

		<h4>Learning curve</h4>
		<p>Every instrument is hard to master, but the first instrument you learn is going to be the hardest. It's also going to act as your point of reference when learning other instruments. You're not just learning how to play an instrument, you're learning music too. After you learn music well enough, you can focus on learning just the mechanical part when picking up another instrument. With that being said, there's a difference when it comes to the learning curve between instruments.</p>
		<p>The biggest factor is whether or not the intonation of the instrument depends more on the player or the instrument itself. If you give the same violin to a professional and a beginner, the sound they produce is going to be worlds apart because the intonation of the violin depends more on the player than the instrument. If you try the same experiment with an acoustic guitar, you're going to notice that the difference is not that big. With a piano, the difference is even smaller. You can say that when it comes to intonation, the violin is the hardest and piano is the easiest. That also means that if you want to change the sound of an instrument like the piano through playing alone, it's going to be really hard to do. In general, instruments like the violin tend to be considered hard to learn because sound production alone is a massive hurdle and you're going to spend a lot of time just working on it, but that's only one part of the learning process.</p>

		<h4>Availability</h4>
		<p>Most common instruments are readily available to buy from a store, including its accessories. There are plenty of teachers nearby who can teach you, and there's an abundance of teaching materials for you to use. But that's not equally true to all of them, and it varies from location to location.</p>
		<p>I'd say the most important part after doing some research and deciding to buy an instrument is to be able to test it before buying. An even better option is to bring along someone who can play it well, or to ask at the store if someone can play it. As a beginner you simply don't have the necessary knowledge to know whether or not an instrument is well-built and has no defects, and you're not able to play it in order to listen to how well it sounds. Instruments in general, even factory-made ones from the same model have some differences, and it's better to be able to test it.</p>
		<p>After buying the instrument, the availability of teachers and teaching materials is going to be the most important part. If it's your first instrument, I strongly recommend you to get a teacher. A teacher can guide you through the basics skills required to play the instrument well, and give you feedback on what you're doing wrong. While it's not impossible to learn everything by yourself, you'll be limited by your research skills and the resources available. The lack of feedback also means that you can learn things the wrong way, and you're only going to notice much later, when it's getting in your way. Fixing something you're already used to do is harder than learning something new. In general, having a teacher is a faster and safer way than learning an instrument by yourself. If it's your second instrument and you're up to the challenge, you can learn it on your own.</p>
		<p>Another aspect when it comes to availability is whether or not you can buy necessary parts and accessories required in order to play the instrument, or if there's a professional who can take care of your instrument in case it needs fixing or some serious maintenance. In case of the accessories and parts, if it's not something urgent, buying online is always an option, but sending your instrument through mail may not be something you want to do in case you need someone to take a look at your instrument.</p>

		<h4>Cost</h4>
		<p>Some instruments are more expensive than others, and need constant investment in order to be kept in good playing condition. With 100$ you can buy a really good plastic recorder. After that, all you need to do is clean it regularly and buy grease when you run out of it. With the same amount of money you can only buy a really bad violin, and you'd need to buy new strings every few weeks or months, buy rosin for your bow, buy a shoulder rest in order to play it, and take it to a luthier for maintenance when needed.</p>

		<p>I'd recommend against choosing an instrument because it's cheap. There's no point in learning how to play an instrument you don't like the sound of, or you don't like its repertoire. There's nothing stopping you from playing whatever you want on a particular instrument, but you can't avoid the repertoire that's associated with it, especially if you're a beginner.</p>
>
		<p>Cheap and affordable are relative terms, but I'd advise you to stay away from anything low-priced without doing a lot of research first. Most communities have a variation of the "instrument shaped object" term that is used to refer to low-priced items that look like an instrument, but fail to perform as one for whatever reason. A violin is a "violin shaped object", or "VSO". A saxophone is a "saxophone shaped object", or "SSO", etc. Trying to fix this kind of cheap instrument usually costs more than buying a decent instrument right off the bat.</p>
		<p>Instead of buying a bad 100$ instrument or buying something you don't want to play but it's affordable, my recommendation is to save and buy a decent one instead, preferably used. If you end up thinking that it's not for you, a decent instrument will still have good resale value. Any new instrument is going to lose some value right after being bought, but cheap instruments lose more value than good ones.</p>
		<p>You can buy cheaper instruments if that's all you can afford at the moment, and then upgrade later, but don't buy the cheapest one available to avoid frustration early on. The biggest problem a cheap instrument has for a complete beginner is that he is unable to know the difference between "is it the instrument or is it me?" whenever he has a problem. A beginner needs an instrument that plays in tune, is responsive and capable of producing a decent sound, and feels good when playing. If your instrument can't play in tune you won't develop your ears and your technique correctly. Depending on the kind of instrument you chose, you'll have to relearn basic technique because you're used to doing the wrong thing.</p>

		<h4>Size and volume</h4>
		<p>You have to take into account where you're going to practice the instrument. Do you live in a house with lots of space, or a crammed apartment with paper-thin walls? Some instruments are really loud and are going to need dedicated practice space if you don't want to bother anyone. Others can be practiced anywhere without a problem. Depending on the instrument, you can buy a mute and reduce the volume it produces. Although I don't recommend it, you can also buy a quieter version instead if available (usually an electric version of said instrument).</p>
		<p>Another factor you have to take into account is the size of the instrument. How much space does it take when not being used? Smaller instruments can fit inside a drawer, even in a case. Slightly bigger ones may take up some room space, but can still fit anywhere. Big ones can take a significant amount of space, and may need a bigger, or even separate room. How do you transport the instrument around? If you don't own a car, can you use public transportation instead, or is the instrument too big to fit inside a bus or a train? If it's too big for public transportation, does it fit inside any car, or does it have to be a specific one? How are you going to take it out of your room? Do you need a trolley to take it outside or do you need to hire someone to move it? If you're going to travel by plane, can it fit inside the overhead bin in an airplane or under the seat? Do you have to reserve a separate seat just for the instrument or send it separately to your destination?</p>
		<p>You should also see how compatible is your physique with the instrument. Instruments are not completely ergonomic and may not be 100% compatible with everyone. Most of the time good posture and technique compensate for an incompatible physique, but there's a limit that can't be overcome through practice. In general, just bear in mind that smaller instruments benefit more from thin and nimble fingers, and bigger instruments require more physical strength and flexibility in order to be played and can't be practiced for long periods of time.</p>
		<p>My recommendation for size is to not get anything too big, unless you have the conditions to do so. The biggest instrument I'd recommend to people is a cello. Be mindful of you neighbors and try not to get anything that's too loud or can't be played without a mute if you're not able to practice somewhere else. The loudest instrument I'd recommend is an acoustic guitar or a baroque flute if you're going to play without a mute.</p>

		<h3>Practice</h3>
		<p>After you choose and buy an instrument, it's time to practice. I've never had a single teacher telling me how to practice, or how to structure my practice time. They just told me to practice without telling me how, unless it was for a specific exercise that they wanted me to play in a very specific manner. Bear in mind that not everything here applies equally well for every single instrument, so feel free to modify it according to your instrument or your necessity. Also, that practice makes permanent, not perfect, and maintaining what you have is easier than building it up.</p>
		<p>First of all, learn some stretching exercises relevant to your instrument. Warm up your muscles every time before and after practice. Lots of people warm up only the hands and ignore the rest of the body. If you feel discomfort in a particular area, learn a stretch that works the affected muscle area. When you start playing an instrument as a kid, you can get away with not stretching and warming up, but as you get older it becomes an absolutely necessary part of practice.</p>
		<p>After warming up, tune your instrument. This varies from one instrument to another, so I'm not going to go over detailed instructions for every one of them. Some instruments don't require tuning every single time you play (like a piano), so if you have one of them, feel free to skip this part.</p>
		<p>If you are just beginning, start with a short amount of practice, and gradually increase it over time. When you start learning an instrument, you're going to use muscles of your body in ways that you're not using in your daily life. Some discomfort may happen because of that. Don't overdo it. At this stage, you should pay extra attention to proper posture. If you get used to wrong posture because "feeling discomfort at the beginning is expected", you'll only start noticing it once it becomes painful.</p>
		<p>Play the instrument for 10 minutes and rest for 10 minutes. Play long notes and scales to warm up, and pay attention to how you're playing it. If you feel you can still keep going, do another section and pay attention to any discomfort and pain. Repeat this and keep increasing the time according to what you feel comfortable.</p>
		<p>In your first weeks, limit yourself to the 30 minutes mark per day. After you feel comfortable, you can increase this limit each week by another 5~10 minutes. Remember to always split your practice into smaller sections to include some rest. Rest is as important as practicing.</p>
		<p>My suggestion is that a section shouldn't be longer than 30 minutes if you're a beginner. Rest at least for 10 minutes between sections. If you're practicing 2 hours a day, your practice would actually be four 30 minutes sections, with 10 minutes of rest in between.</p>
		<p>Consistency is really important when it comes to practice. Try to practice every day for at least 30 minutes instead of practicing for 3 hours in a single day. You can take a rest one day of the week if you feel necessary.</p>

		<p>Based on my own experience and from people around me, I've written the following guidelines when it comes to practice time. Bear in mind that they are based on average learners. You should adjust your practice according to your own current needs.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>30 minutes per day: the least amount of practice anyone should aim to do, even as a hobby.</li>
			<li>60~90 minutes per day: usually when you start to get serious.</li>
			<li>2~5 hours per day: where most pros and semi-pros fall into, and individual differences start to become apparent.</li>
			<li>Over 5 hours a day: not recommended.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>General stuff appliable to all instruments</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Take your time, do some research, and try before you buy. Preferably with a teacher or someone who can play the instrument well.</li>
			<li>Every instrument is hard to master, but they have different learning curves. Some instruments need more practice than others to go from complete beginner to decent. From decent to good, and good to professional, it tends to be the roughly the same between instruments.</li>
			<li>Every instrument has a compromise of some sort, no instrument is perfect. You can't have an instrument that does everything perfectly.</li>
			<li>Depending on the instrument, the amount of time you can practice every day is going to differ. Bigger instruments are going to make you tired faster than smaller ones. You need to break in some instrument before being able to play for longer periods of time (like wooden flutes, recorders, or the human voice). Trying to play for long periods of time from the beginning is going to damage the instrument.</li>
			<li>Learn how to play on a standard sized instrument with standard tuning. Also, learn proper posture and technique. Most problems regarding size usually comes down to poor posture and technique. Much like learning non-standard technique because "it works for me", changing the tuning of the instrument may make things easier on the beginning, but usually leads to problems down the line.</li>
			<li>Learn how to do basic care and maintenance, like cleaning and changing parts (like strings). Also learn how to tune your instrument. Tune before you start playing, and clean after you stop playing. Change parts as necessary, which can range from every few weeks to every few months.</li>
			<li>Get a tuner and a metronome. I recommend buying a tuner from a trusted brand. Some of them come with a metronome, but in this case a smartphone app is fine too. After you get comfortable tuning the instrument using a tuner, you can start learning how to tune it by ear.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>General questions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Can I play X music on Y instrument?</li>
			<p>Usually, yes. The only physical limitation is whether the instrument can play all the notes necessary. In other words, if it fits the range of the instrument and all the notes can be played, then yes. If it can be transcribed to fit the instrument, also yes. Other than that, the only problem is other people judging you for playing something they think is "inappropriate" or whatever.</p>
			<li>Do I need to learn how to read sheet music or should I play by ear?</li>
			<p>You need to learn both. Some people like to think of this question as a choice between one OR the other, when in fact they complement each other. You should train your ear regardless of whether you can read sheet music or not, and knowing sheet music or other forms or notation will only expand your abilities. Not everything can be learned by ear, because not everything ever written has a recording or people playing around you. Also, music tends to change over time when passed down aurally. You can use any method or read any music from any period of history. After you learn how the music is supposed to sound using sheet music, you can learn it by ear.</p>
			<li>Do I need music theory?</li>
			<p>Yes and no. You can learn an instrument without knowing music theory and get the same knowledge over time, or you can take a shortcut and just learn it.</p>
