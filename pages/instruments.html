		<p>A list of instruments I currently own.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hering 1923 Vintage Harp in C</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2009. Played for about a year. It's a very beautiful and well-built harmonica, but felt hard to play.</p>

			<li>Copy of a Stradivarius Violin</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2007. It was built in the late 1910s. The previous owner told me that it's from an unknown Italian maker, and it was around 90 years old at the time I bought it.</p>

			<li>Aulos AF-1 Grenser Baroque Flute</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. Pitched at A=440Hz. The flute I play the most.</p>

			<li>Aulos AF-3 Stanesby Jr. Baroque Flute</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 with the Grenser. It came with a hard case (AF-3H). Pitched at A=415Hz. A bit harder to play than the Grenser due to the larger size.</p>

			<li>Tony Dixon DX006 Tin Whistle in D</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020.</p>

			<li>Aulos 353B (E) Symphony Bass Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 with a hard case. Surprisingly, it's easier to play than the Yamaha tenor, despite its larger size.</p>

			<li>Aulos 507B (E) Symphony Sopranino Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020.</p>

			<li>Aulos 501S (E) Symphony Garklein Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020.</p>

			<li>Zen-On G1A Bressan Alto Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. My second alto. It requires better air control than the YRA-314B in order to play well. The higher notes in particular.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRA-314BIII Alto Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 as a set (YRSA-314BIII). I liked the sound of the alto, but the range felt restrictive to me.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRS-314BIII Soprano Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020 as a set (YRSA-314BIII).</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRT-304BII Tenor Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020.</p>

			<li>Aulos 211A (E) Robin Tenor Recorder</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. It's easier to play than the Yamaha tenor due to lack of keys.</p>

			<li>Yamaha YRF-21 Fife</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020. I didn't like the mouthpiece.</p>

			<li>Aulos C-21 Pipit Fife</li>
			<p class="comment">Bought in 2020.</p>
